# UCSC-OOAD-project-x
Project X for OOAD class at UCSC, personal trainer app.  

This web application is designed to allow a trainee to perform exercise routines assigned to them by their trainer.  The personal trainer puts together exercise routines for their trainees using the app.  The trainee then performs the routine and enters information about the routine into the app.  The app allows the personal trainer to track the progress of their trainees based on the ability of their trainees to complete each of the exercises in a routine.  This way, the personal trainer is able to customize routines based on previous performance.
